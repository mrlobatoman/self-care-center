# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
If someone is feeling down, or wants to practice/ positive affirmations then they can utilize a website I/ designed. There are 2 options to select, either mantra/ or affirmations. Once an option is selected and they/ click the "Receive Message" button the website will/ generate a sentence based on the option selected. The/ intentions are to give the user the confidence and/ morale booster they need to get through the day.

My personal wins were better understanding flexbox and\ using flexbox in dev tools. Another win was figuring\ out the gradient, because I've never done that before.\
I had some personal-life struggles that's happened\ during this project.. and unfortunately I didn't\ respond or handle it in a way that allowed me to finish\ this project.
